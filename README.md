# SimConnectWasmHUB

 SimConnect and WASM tryout

 This repository is mainly intended to support a tutorial on the FlightSimulator forum. More info will be provided in this readme file.

 The project is built with VS2019. When building the project, there might be 2 things to do first:
 1) Make sure that the Configuration Properties of the Solution has 'Build' enabled for the WASM_HABI project
 2) Make sure that the target platform is set to x64
